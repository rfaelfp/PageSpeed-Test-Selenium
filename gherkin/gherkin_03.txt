Third Scenario

Functionality: Creating an API route
Scenario: Link building with 10 mid-level questions
As I navigate to the API page
And I type the value '5' in the number of questions field,
And I select the 'medium' difficulty option in the combobox
And select the 'mythology' option in the category
When I click on the 'generate API URL' button
Then on the new page the API link is displayed.
