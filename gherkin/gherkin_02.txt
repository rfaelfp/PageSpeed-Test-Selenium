Second Scenario

Functionality: Search by category
Scenario: Search for items by category in the question bank
As I navigate to the question bank search page
And I type 'Science: Computers' into the search field.
And select the 'Category' option
When I click the search button
Then I visualize a table with 25 items and the page control.
