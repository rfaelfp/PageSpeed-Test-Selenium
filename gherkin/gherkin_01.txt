First part

We have the following scenario, written in Gherkin, that we should automate:

Functionality: Question Bank Search
Scenario: Search by nonexistent question
As I navigate to the question bank search page
And I type 'Science: Computers' into the search field.
When I click the search button
Then I get an error message with the text 'No questions found.'

You will now take this scenario and automate it on the previous site.
